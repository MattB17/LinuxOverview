# Compiling
To compile a program called `helloWorld.c` with all warnings using gcc:
* `$gcc -Wall helloWorld.c`
* outputs a file called `a.out` in same directory
* To run the file -> `$./a.out`

If you want to specify a name for the compiled file use `-o`
* `$gcc -Wall -o helloWorld.out helloWorld.c`
* Then to run the program -> `$./helloWorld.out`
