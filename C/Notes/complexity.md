# Complexity
Given two correct functions with the same functionality and both are correct
* prefer the one that is faster and more readable

Big-O notation
* a representation of the growth rate of a function

`f(n) = O(g(n))`
* means there are positive constants `c` and `k` such that `0 <= f(n) <= cg(n)` for all `n >= k`
